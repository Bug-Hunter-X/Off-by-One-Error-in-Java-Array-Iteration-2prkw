# Off-by-One Error in Java Array Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays.  The `BuggyArray.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `FixedArray.java` provides the corrected version.  This error occurs when the loop index goes beyond the bounds of the array, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

The bug is explained in detail in the files and a solution is provided. This is a classic example of a subtle but impactful programming mistake.
